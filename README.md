# pinephone_helpers
some scripts and .desktop entries I made for my pinephone; they should work for any pinephone running postmarketOS

## restarters
bash scripts and .desktop files to restart the modem or the wifi because they sometimes stop working

How to install:

Dependancies:
- pkexec
- adwaita theme
