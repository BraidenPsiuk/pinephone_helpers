# pinephone_helpers
some scripts and .desktop entries I made for my pinephone; they should work for any pinephone running postmarketOS

## restarters
bash scripts and .desktop files to restart the modem or the wifi because they sometimes stop working

## How to install:
- Save modem_restart.sh, wifi_restart.sh, modem_restart.desktop, and wifi_restart.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications
- you may have to replace the home path in the .desktop files if your user is not "user"

## Dependancies:
- pkexec
- adwaita theme
